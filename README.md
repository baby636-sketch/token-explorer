## Token-explorer

This is the code repository for my [Token-explorer](https://token-explorer.netlify.app/), a token explorer for CashTokens on chipnet. <br>

### How it was made

Started from the [mainnet-js React-next](https://github.com/mainnet-cash/mainnet-js/tree/master/demo/react-next) example. <br>
[Mainnet-js](https://mainnet.cash/) is used to import onchain linked Bitcoin Cash Metadata Registries (BCMR). <br>
The [chaingraph demo instance](https://chipnet.chaingraph.cash) is used to query on-chain token info such as the genesis transaction, the genesis supply of FT and active minting UTXOs. <br>
