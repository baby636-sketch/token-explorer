## Token-explorer

This is the code repository for my [Token-explorer](https://token-explorer.netlify.app/), a token explorer for CashTokens on chipnet. <br>

### How it was made

Started from the [mainnet-js React-next](https://github.com/mainnet-cash/mainnet-js/tree/master/demo/react-next) example.
The [chaingraph demo instance](https://chipnet.chaingraph.cash) is used to query on-chain tokeen info about gensis supply and minting UTXOs. <br>
